Profile to work with YourControls application and MSFS2020. If you find any bugs, please contact me on YourControls Discord: Dkgolfnut_Dennis

# Known Issues:
 - The Altitude knob is not synchonized. Both pilots will need to adjust both the Tablet (1's or 100's selection) and manually change the Altitude value to mach the other pilot.
 - Payload/Passenger slider on Tablet should be set by the Host prior to the second pilot joining.   If it is adjusted with both pilots connected the slider oscilates and causes weight issues.
   
 - *** Please kindly note that this plane from MSFS has numerous unselectable switches. This is a MSFS model/featureset issue, not a YC's or the Profile I created issue.


# FIXED: 
All MID cockpit Radio officer, Engineer station, and Electrical officer funtionality has been added 

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
